# Reader
Reading is fundamental, fun to mental no pun intended üòè. Reader is an open source audio book generator that aims to make reading fun to mental.  It supports PDF books with both text and image based and converts them to high quality audio files stored at user google drive. Since audio conversion is a resource expensive operation, Reader will inform users with the completion through their Gmail accounts.
